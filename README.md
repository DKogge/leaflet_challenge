Module 15

Created a map of the earthquake data plotting each earthquake location from the last week with a circle with a radius corresponding to the severity of the earthquake.
The colors of the circle also indicate the depth of the earthquake with the legend describing the range.  Darker colors being deeper. 

Used the leaflet website for much of the code and the additional CSS code that was added.  A tutor assisted with the circles and legend portions.

Here is a small sample of the map:
