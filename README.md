# leaflet_challenge
Module 15

Created a map of the earthquake data plotting each earthquake location from the last week with a circle with a radius corresponding to the severity of the earthquake.
The colors of the circle also indicate the severity of the earthquake with the legend describing the range.  The darker colors indicate a more severe earthquake.

Used the leaflet website for much of the code and the additional CSS code that was added.  A tutor assisted with the circles and legend portions.
